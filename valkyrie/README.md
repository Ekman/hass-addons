Valkyrie is a backup solution for Home Assistant. Backing up your data is important, you dont want to loose countless hours spent on configuring your smart home. It should also be simple and quick to get up-and-running.

The purpose of this application is to create a solution that strikes a balance between:

* **Do it yourself (DIY)** - You will probably need to create some access credentials for the platform you want to backup to. Seeing you are a Home Assistant user already, this is a walk in the park!
* **Extensibility** - Is your favourite platform not supported? Head over to our repository and contribute (or request) a new platform. The heavy business logic is already done for you, you will just need to implement an interface.
* **Maintainability** - This addon will never be the "one solution fits all". Feature requests will be chosen with care to keep the addon easy to extend while still covering 90% of the backup use cases.
